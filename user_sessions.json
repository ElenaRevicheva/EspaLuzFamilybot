I completely understand this challenge - it's so common for children in bilingual families, especially when living in a country where the community language feels more \"cool\" or necessary for fitting in.\n\nThis is actually very normal, friend. Your daughter might feel that Spanish isn't as \"useful\" in Panama since everyone around her speaks Spanish already, or she might associate English with being more international or modern. Children often go through phases where they resist their heritage language.\n\nHere are some gentle strategies that work well:\n\n**Make Spanish fun and relevant:**\n- Connect it to things she loves - if she likes music, find Spanish songs from artists she might enjoy\n- Use Spanish for special activities like cooking traditional Russian-Panamanian fusion meals together\n- Let her teach YOU Panamanian slang in Spanish - kids love being the teacher!\n\n**Reduce pressure:**\n- Don't force conversations entirely in Spanish\n- Accept code-switching (mixing languages) as normal\n- Celebrate small wins when she does use Spanish\n\n**Create positive associations:**\n- Connect Spanish to her identity as someone who bridges cultures\n- Show her how being trilingual (Russian-Spanish-English) is actually a superpower in Panama's international business environment\n\nRemember, friend, language development isn't linear. She might come back to Spanish more enthusiastically later, especially as she gets older and realizes its value. ¿Has she expressed why she doesn't want to speak it?\n\n[VIDEO SCRIPT START]\nHola friend! Es completamente normal que los niños pasen por fases así. \nHello friend!

When you're speaking with locals and want to show you really understand something important, this kind of emphasis works perfectly.\n\nFor example, if someone gives you directions to Casco Viejo: \"¿Entendido?\" - \"¡Entendido, entendido!\"\n\n¿Quieres que practiquemos algunas situaciones donde esta repetición sería útil en tu vida diaria en Panamá?
