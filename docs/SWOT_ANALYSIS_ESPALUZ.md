## 📝 KEY TALKING POINTS (For Pitches)

**On Pre-Revenue Status:**
> "We're pre-revenue by strategic choice—we spent months building production-grade infrastructure before activating monetization. Payment systems are ready; we now need capital to activate user acquisition."

**On Competition:**
> "We're the only platform combining emotional intelligence + family awareness + multi-platform + Web3 ownership. Duolingo gamifies, ChatGPT is generic, Babbel is traditional courses. We're solving the deeper human problem: cultural adaptation and emotional support during life transitions."

**On Market Opportunity:**
> "$37B TAM across AI assistants and language learning. We're starting with 280M expats plus 50M local service providers in 19 Spanish-speaking countries. Even at 1% penetration, that's 2.8M users and $84M ARR potential."
